<a id="the-cause"></a>
<strong><em>Accepting the Raspberry Pi OS prompt to update the system results in my natively built 64-bit Fully Preemptible Kernel (Real-Time) being removed and the original kernel reinstalled! ü§¨</em></strong>

‚ù∂ Toward the end of October 2024, I finished building a <code>64-bit Fully Preemptible 
Kernel (Real-Time)</code> for use with LinuxCNC, 
<a href="https://behai-nguyen.github.io/2024/11/03/pi-4b-preempt-rt-kernel-patch.html" 
title="Raspberry Pi 4B: Natively Build a 64 Bit Fully Preemptible Kernel (Real-Time) with Desktop" 
target="_blank">as documented</a>. I received the

title="7I96S STEP/IO Step & dir plus I/O card" 
target="_blank">7I96S STEP/IO Step & dir plus I/O card</a> on 22/01/2025. 
On 05/02/2025, I was able to run the Mesa Configuration Wizard, 
<a href="https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/config/pncconf.html"
title="PnCconf Mesa Configuration Wizard" target="_blank">PnCconf</a>. 
When clicking on the <code>Test / Tune Axis</code>, I got the above message as illustrated in the following screenshot:

![pncconf-02.png](https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/pncconf-02.png)

I actually built LinuxCNC from source and installed the locally built package. 
I followed the instructions to the letter but thought my build had issues. 
Unsure of what had happened, I 
<a href="https://forum.linuxcnc.org/39-pncconf/55238-pncconf-mesa-7i96s-you-are-using-a-simulated-realtime-version-of-linuxcnc" 
title="PNCConf, Mesa 7I96S: &quot;You are using a simulated-realtime version of LinuxCNC...&quot;" 
target="_blank">sought help</a> from the forum. I was advised to use the official image: 
<a href="https://linuxcnc.org/iso/rpi-4-debian-bookworm-6.12.11-arm64-ext4-2025-01-27-0404.img.xz" 
title="https://linuxcnc.org/iso/rpi-4-debian-bookworm-6.12.11-arm64-ext4-2025-01-27-0404.img.xz" 
target="_blank">https://linuxcnc.org/iso/rpi-4-debian-bookworm-6.12.11-arm64-ext4-2025-01-27-0404.img.xz</a>.
I heeded the advice, as seen in previous posts.

I still had another SD card with the real-time kernel and LinuxCNC mentioned above. 
In an effort to understand the issue, on 17th February 2025, I removed my original build 
and installation of LinuxCNC 2.9.3, downloaded, and installed the 
<a href="https://www.linuxcnc.org/dists/bookworm/2.9-uspace/binary-arm64/linuxcnc-uspace_2.9.4_arm64.deb" 
title="LinuxCNC 2.9.4 Package" target="_blank">linuxcnc-uspace_2.9.4_arm64.deb</a> 
package. The commands to remove and install are: 

```
$ sudo apt remove linuxcnc-uspace
$ sudo dpkg -i /home/behai/Public/linuxcnc-uspace_2.9.4_arm64.deb
```

This time, I was able to run 
<a href="https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/config/pncconf.html"
title="PnCconf Mesa Configuration Wizard" target="_blank">PnCconf</a> successfully, as 
mentioned in previous posts. I was convinced that my LinuxCNC 2.9.3 build was 
the problem üòÇ. I shut down <code>PnCconf</code> to run the latency test. 
Raspberry Pi OS notified me of pending updates, which I accepted. Then I started the 
<code>HAL Latency Test</code> application. With only three instances of 
<code>glxgears</code> running, the Max Jitter for the <strong>Base Thread</strong> 
reached nearly <strong>500,000 nanoseconds</strong>!

I was quite taken aback. The previous latency 
<a href="https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/2025/02/13/raspberry-pi-4b-linuxcnc-max-jitter-or-latency-test/" 
title="Raspberry Pi 4B: LinuxCNC Max Jitter or Latency Test" target="_blank">test results</a> 
were nowhere near this bad: the tests were conducted on a different OS, but the hardware was 
the same. When I looked at the <code>Kernel-version</code> field on the <code>HAL Latency 
Test</code> screen, it showed <code>PREEMPT</code> not <code>PREEMPT_RT</code>.

üí• That was when I realised that <strong><em>accepting the Raspberry Pi OS prompt to update the system led to the custom-built 64-bit Fully Preemptible Kernel (Real-Time) being removed and the original kernel reinstalled!</em></strong>

Just to be doubly certain, I ran 
<a href="https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/config/pncconf.html"
title="PnCconf Mesa Configuration Wizard" target="_blank">PnCconf</a> 
again and expected the above message to appear ‚Äî and it did. 
<strong>I accepted the prompted update on the first SD card too.</strong>

<a id="rebuild-the-os-image"></a>
‚ù∑ Three months have passed since November 2024, and it‚Äôs time for a new updated real-time kernel. 
Following the 
<a href="https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/2024/11/03/raspberry-pi-4b-natively-build-a-64-bit-fully-preemptible-kernel-real-time-with-desktop/" 
title="Raspberry Pi 4B: Natively Build a 64 Bit Fully Preemptible Kernel (Real-Time) with Desktop" 
target="_blank">first post</a>, I successfully built a real-time kernel version 
<code>6.6.77-rt50</code>: 

![135-01.png](https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/135-01.png)

With this version, we need to install <code>ifupdown</code>, which is a set of high-level scripts to configure network interfaces. The command to install it is:

```
$ sudo apt install ifupdown
```

Before we can install the downloaded LinuxCNC 2.9.4 
<a href="https://www.linuxcnc.org/dists/bookworm/2.9-uspace/binary-arm64/linuxcnc-uspace_2.9.4_arm64.deb" 
title="LinuxCNC 2.9.4 Package" target="_blank">linuxcnc-uspace_2.9.4_arm64.deb</a> 
package, we need to install the missing packages. The command is: 

```
$ sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

Then, finally: 

```
$ sudo dpkg -i /home/behai/Public/linuxcnc-uspace_2.9.4_arm64.deb
```

<a href="https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/config/pncconf.html"
title="PnCconf Mesa Configuration Wizard" target="_blank">PnCconf</a> now runs, and 
LinuxCNC also ‚Äúruns‚Äù. I am able to move along the X-axis, and the single stepper motor 
(please refer to

<a id="latency-test"></a>
‚ù∏ We will not describe the test sequence in detail. Briefly, the test ran for more than an hour. With 12 instances of <code>glxgears</code>, the Max Jitter for the two threads remained constant at:

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<strong>Servo Thread</strong>: 98,571 nanoseconds (98.571 microseconds)
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">

</li>
</ul>

‚ùπ I had no plan to write this post, but what I have found is rather unexpected and quite interesting. Hopefully, this post will be helpful to someone in the future.

If you happen to read this post, thank you for your time, and I hope I did not waste it. Stay safe, as always.
