target="_blank">this post</a>. I also ordered this PSU online, again shipped from 
a warehouse in Texas, U.S.A.

At this stage, I still have only one driver and one motor; I have not purchased the other 
three yet. Let‚Äôs discuss why this PSU is suitable.

<code>UHP-750-36</code> specifications:

<ol>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
Output Voltage (Channel 1): 36 VDC 
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
Output Power: 752.4 W
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
Input Voltage: 90‚Äì264 VAC, 127‚Äì370 VDC 
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
Output Current (Channel 1): 20.9 A 
</li>
</ol>

The <code>Nema 23</code> stepper motors require 24‚Äì48 VDC. I am in Australia, where the 
nominal AC voltage is 
<a href="https://wilken.com.au/voltage-electrical-outlets-australia/" 
title="What Is the Voltage of Electrical Outlets in Australia?" 
target="_blank">230‚Äì240 VAC</a>. Therefore, the PSU <code>input voltage</code> and 
<code>output voltage</code> are appropriate. According to this Stepper Online article: 
<a href="https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/support/how-to-choose-a-power-supply-for-my-stepper-motor" 
title="How to choose a power supply for my stepper motor?" 
target="_blank">How to choose a power supply for my stepper motor?</a>, the 
<strong>maximum power draw (P) in watts to run all four <code>Nema 23</code> 
stepper motors at full current and under full load at the same time is</strong>:

<strong><code>P = n √ó I √ó V √ó 1.2</code></strong>

where:

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<strong>n</strong>: the total number of stepper motors, here <strong>4</strong>.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<strong>I</strong>: the maximum current drawn by each motor, <strong>4.2 A</strong>.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<strong>V</strong>: the voltage required by each motor, <strong>36 VDC</strong>.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<strong>1.2</strong>: the ‚Äúkindness factor‚Äù ‚Äî a <strong>20% safety margin</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

Therefore: <strong><code>P = 4 √ó 4.2 √ó 36 √ó 1.2 = 725.76 W</code></strong>.

The total current draw at full load would be: <strong><code>4 √ó 4.2 A = 16.8 A</code></strong>.

Both the PSU <code>output power</code> and <code>output current</code> are 
appropriate. <strong>In practice, all motors running at full current and under full 
load simultaneously is rare</strong>.

‚ù∑ <strong>The EMI Filter</strong>

In the aforementioned LinuxCNC forum thread, 
<a href="https://forum.linuxcnc.org/18-computer/55831-4-gang-1-way-switch-to-control-3-power-supplies-and-a-router-independently#325751"

target="_blank">240V AC EMI Filter</a>, which I was able to get from a local Jaycar store.

After a rather long learning process, I arrived at this first working wiring:

‚ù∏ <strong>The Emergency Stop Button, the Main Switch, and Their Cable Glands</strong>

<a id="estop"></a>
‚ìµ I had never actually seen an emergency stop button by itself before. After some 
research, I decided on this eBay model: 
<a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/395284988266" 
title="Push Buttons Switch 1NO + 1NC e-stop Push Button AU Emergency Stop Shut Off" 
target="_blank">Push Buttons Switch 1NO + 1NC e-stop Push Button AU Emergency Stop Shut Off</a> 
‚Äî it provides one Normally Open (NO) and one Normally Closed (NC) contact. 

It is inexpensive, and the quality reflects the price. However, it is still usable. 
The terminals are not labelled NC or NO, but my friend helped me identify which pair 
was which.  

This Instructables article: 
<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Emergency-Stop-Button/" 
title="Emergency Stop Button" target="_blank">Emergency Stop Button</a> explains 
wiring using the NC contact. I followed those instructions successfully and tested 
the setup using a 240 VAC microwave fan. Unfortunately, I held the wires with 
alligator clips, and vibration from the fan caused a short circuit. This blew the 
main fuse and disabled about half of the outlets in my house. Luckily, with some 
guidance over the phone, I was able to reset the fuse and restore power.  
Lesson learned: never rely on loose clip connections for mains wiring.

This e-stop button came with a single cable gland. Since I also needed to secure the 
output cable, I added this 
<a href="https://www.altronics.com.au/p/h4382-11-14mm-mg20-black-ip68-ul94-cable-gland/"
title="11-14mm MG20 Black IP68 Nylon Cable Gland" target="_blank">11‚Äì14 mm MG20 Black 
IP68 Nylon Cable Gland</a>. It turned out visibly larger than the supplied one.

<a id="main-switch"></a>
‚ì∂ For the main switch, I chose this model: 
<a href="https://directwholesale.com.au/products/clipsal-easy56-easy56-switch-1p-10a-250v-ey56sw110/" 
title="Schneider Electric Easy 56 Switch - 1P - 10A - 250V - EY56SW110" 
target="_blank">Schneider Electric Easy 56 Switch ‚Äî 1P, 10A, 250V, EY56SW110</a>.  
Although the website listed the dimensions, I overlooked them and only realised 
on arrival that it is much larger than the e-stop. That said, it is very sturdy 
and well built. The lower half of the casing has one large threaded opening on one 
side and two smaller ones on the other, all sealed with caps. These are intended 
for the incoming and outgoing cables.

To secure the cables, I purchased one 
<a href="https://www.power-supplies-australia.com.au/power-source-pgland-m32-plastic-pa66-cable-gland" 
title="POWER SOURCE PGLAND-M32 Plastic PA66 Cable Gland M32 - 18-25mm IP68"

and two

target="_blank">POWER SOURCE PGLAND-M25 Plastic PA66 Cable Glands (12.5‚Äì18 mm, IP68)</a> 
‚Äî even though I only needed one. Aesthetically, using one large and one small gland 
made the switch look unbalanced and somewhat awkward.

üí° None of these glands could properly grip the standard cables I used. Even when 
fully tightened, the fit was too loose. As a workaround, I shimmed the cables with 
short lengths of cut water hose. While effective, this is not ideal.

‚ùπ <strong>Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB) for the PSUs</strong>

From what I have learned, choosing MCBs for power supplies involves two main requirements. 
First, the <strong>nominal current rating</strong> must be correct. Second, the 
<strong>tripping curve</strong> must suit the PSU‚Äôs inrush current at the input AC voltage.

For calculating the nominal current, I found the following references helpful:

</p>

The datasheet states <strong>3.8A at 230VAC</strong>, this is steady-state current draw. 
The theoretical AC input current calculated above matches well with this value. 
<strong>3.8A</strong> is the value we should use to calculate the MCB's nominal current: 
<strong><code>3.8 √ó 1.25 = 4.75A</code></strong>.

The MCB for the <code>UHP-750-36</code> PSU should have the following characteristics:

‚óè A <strong>5A</strong> or <strong>6A</strong> MCB would be most appropriate. 
Both are <strong>above the continuous draw</strong> but still tight enough to 
protect in the event of an overload or fault. 6A offers slightly better tolerance, 
especially with minor surges or long cable runs. 5A offers a stricter cutoff, but 
may trip if the PSU is run at full continuous load.

‚óè <strong>Type C trip curve</strong> tolerates inrushes up to <strong>30A‚Äì60A</strong>, 
which safely covers the <strong>40A</strong> inrush.

‚óè Voltage should be <strong>230VAC-240VAC</strong> to match the Australian standard.

</ol>

The <code>Power Factor</code> is not given, <code>Theoretical Average Input Current</code> 
can not be calculated, but we do not need it anyhow, since the <em>steady-state current 
draw</em> is available: <strong>0.21A at 230VAC</strong>.

The MCB for the <code>MDR-10-5</code> PSU should have the following characteristics:

‚óè A <strong>1A</strong> or <strong>2A</strong> MCB is sufficient. 
2A provides more margin and is more tolerant of transient events. 
Due to the high inrush current (70A), nuisance tripping is possible even with 
a type C device. If that occurs, a larger MCB (for example, 6A) can be used, 
since the PSU itself has internal protection against overloads and short circuits.

‚óè <strong>Type C trip curve</strong> would <strong>absorb inrush current</strong>
of <strong>70A</strong> without nuisance tripping.

‚óè Voltage should be <strong>230VAC-240VAC</strong> to match the Australian standard.

I bought the <code>MDR-10-5</code> PSU from a local supplier, but they did not stock 
DIN rail in the required specification. Other local suppliers had it available, 
but only in 2-metre lengths‚Äîfar more than I needed‚Äîand at a higher cost. Instead, 
I settled on a cheaper aluminium version:

Back on 13 April 2025, it was priced at AUD 23.89. While it does not feel as sturdy as 
the steel version, it should be perfectly adequate for the job.

‚ùª <strong>DIN Rail Terminals, DIN Rail Fuse Holder and the Main Fuse</strong>

In the same LinuxCNC forum thread, 
<a href="https://forum.linuxcnc.org/18-computer/55831-4-gang-1-way-switch-to-control-3-power-supplies-and-a-router-independently#325751" 
title="Main Power Distribution" target="_blank">Mr. RodW</a> recommended using DIN rail terminals. 
I was able to source them locally: I could check them both online and in-store, which I prefer. 
Here‚Äôs what I purchased:

four blocks together can accommodate 8 live wires.

have metal clamps at the base, so the DIN rail itself acts as a natural conductor, connecting 
them all together as a common ground. Each terminal has two connection points, so technically 
I only needed three. I bought six because the salesperson didn‚Äôt know about this feature, and 
I didn‚Äôt bother returning the extras.

the store did not stock <strong>6A</strong> M205 fuses. These are also <strong>fast-blow</strong>, 
while I should really be using <strong>slow-blow</strong> (time-delay) fuses.
</li>
</ol>

üí° <strong>Why a 6A Fuse?</strong>

As described previously, the typical AC input currents for each PSU are:

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<a href="#mcb-mdr-10-5">MDR-10-5</a>: <strong>0.21 A</strong>
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<a href="#mcb-mdr-100-24">MDR-100-24</a>: <strong>0.8 A</strong>
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
<a href="#mcb-uhp-750-36">UHP-750-36</a>: <strong>3.8 A</strong>
</li>
</ul>

Together, that adds up to <strong>4.81 A</strong>. Adding a <strong>25%</strong> safety margin 
brings it to about <strong>6.01 A</strong>.

‚ùº <strong>First Attempt</strong>

The image below shows my first working attempt at wiring everything together:

|:--:|
| **First Working Attempt** |

By <em>working</em>, I mean that I tested this wiring using the 
<a href="https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/config/pncconf.html" title="Mesa Configuration 
Wizard" target="_blank">Linux PnCconf</a>, and the stepper motor responded to software 
commands. I also asked a friend to review the setup, and he recommended adding a main fuse 
<a href="#din-rail-terminals-main-fuse">as described here</a>. The revised wiring is shown below:

| **An Improved Version** |

In fact, this was the wiring in place when I tested the contactor as described in the last 
post: <a href="https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/2025/07/01/raspberry-pi-4b-linuxcnc-wiring-the-mesa-7i96s-card-and-a-contactor-to-control-a-grinder-router-via-the-linuxcnc-application/"

<a id="secondary-switches"></a>
‚ùΩ <strong>Adding Secondary Switches to Control Each PSU Independently</strong>

The RCBO and MCBs previously <a href="#psu-mcb">discussed</a> each have an on/off switch, which could be used to control their respective PSUs. However, that‚Äôs not their intended purpose. I‚Äôd prefer to install dedicated switches for this function. While not strictly necessary, it would be a nice addition. I haven‚Äôt purchased the switches yet, and the wiring remains unchanged from the last image above.

This is the switch I have in mind: 
<a href="https://www.altronics.com.au/p/s3244-dpst-illuminated-neon-ip65-weatherproof-rocker-switch/" 
title="DPST 16A IP65 Weatherproof Rocker Switch" target="_blank">DPST 16A IP65 
Weatherproof Rocker Switch</a>. It‚Äôs available at a nearby store, which saves on delivery fees, and the pricing is quite reasonable. I‚Äôve revised the previous wiring picture into four smaller, focused images.

üí• For the switch above, I‚Äôm not yet certain which terminals correspond to <strong>Live</strong> and which to <strong>Neutral</strong>. In the following images, please treat the switch connections as illustrative only‚Äînot technically precise.

<a id="concluding-remarks"></a>
‚ùæ It has taken me several months‚Äîthough not full-time‚Äîto learn and assemble this wiring setup. I‚Äôm not yet certain how well it performs in a real-world scenario, but so far, it behaves as expected. I‚Äôll post updates whenever there‚Äôs something meaningful to document.

Although the title of this post is ‚ÄúRaspberry Pi 4B LinuxCNC: Main Power Distribution (Wiring),‚Äù it should be clear that the wiring described here isn‚Äôt specific to the Raspberry Pi 4B. This same setup can be used with any computer running LinuxCNC.

If you‚Äôve taken the time to read this post‚Äîthank you. I hope it was worth your time. Stay safe out there.
