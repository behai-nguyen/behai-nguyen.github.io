| *2000s flashback: a web API service...* |

Going through my old files, I happened to find this diagram on a larger 
project which I was employed as a developer back in late 2001 early 2002:

![040-diagram.jpg](https://behainguyen.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/040-diagram.jpg)

The diagram was by my project manager. 
Other team members and I were assigned to the 
<span style="color:blue;">blue box</span>: 

<ul>
<li style="margin-top:5px;">
For web clients, we returned complete 
<span class="keyword">
HTML</span> pages.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
For 
<span class="keyword">
Windows executable</span> clients, we returned only data. So the
web server application was also kind of providing 
<span class="keyword">
Web API service</span>.
</li>
</ul>

Back then, 
<span class="keyword">
XML</span> was only a few years old... The project manager decided
not to use it: too heavy with all the tags, bandwidth and speed 
were factors in this decision.
<span class="keyword">
JSON</span> has just come out, and we were not yet aware of it...
I don't recall it was ever mentioned in any of the project meetings.

The project manager decided to go with “our own text format”: we
packaged data up on the server-side using this format, returned it
via <span class="keyword">
HTTPS</span>, and at the client-side, the data was parsed into the 
<span class="keyword">
Borland VCL client dataset</span> ready for further manipulation.

It was fun, but time-consuming, column values boundaries did pose
some difficulties especially with blob values. 2022 -- we just use 
<span class="keyword">JSON</span> 😝

I have forgotten about this project... finding this diagram brings
back some memories, I felt the urge to write this post.

Back then, online gaming was still a new industry, there were 
new legislations just put in place, we were not required to go 
through any security check, but we were issued with a <em>special 
employee licence</em>, there were certain gambling activities that 
we were not allowed to participate while working in the industry:

Over the years... my hair decided to go... Painful, but what can I do
😾. Thank you for reading. And stay safe.
