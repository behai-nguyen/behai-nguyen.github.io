| *Installing Python 3.12.4 as an Additional Interpreter on Ubuntu 22.10 and Windows 10* |

<a id="on-windows-10"></a>
‚ù∂ Let's cover Windows 10 first, since it is simpler.

<ol>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
Go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" title="Python Releases for Windows" 
target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</a> and download the 
appropriate installer for your Windows 10 machine, such as <code>python-3.12.4-amd64.exe</code>.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px;">
Run the installer as an Administrator. Choose the custom installation 
option to install it to <code>C:\PF\Python312\</code>.
</li>
</ol>	

Please note that the <code>C:\PF\Python312\Scripts\</code> directory now 
contains only the following executables: <code>pip.exe</code>, <code>pip3.12.exe</code> 
and <code>pip3.exe</code>. The executable <code>virtualenv.exe</code> is no longer 
included.

<a id="windows-10-venv-virtual-env"></a>
To create a virtual environment (<code>venv</code>) for Python 3.12.4, 
use the following command:

```
C:\PF\Python312\python.exe -m venv venv
```

<a id="on-ubuntu-22-10"></a>
‚ù∑ On Ubuntu 22.10, I succeeded the first time, but I just did 
not know where it was installed üòÇ.

On June 25, 2022, I installed Python 3.9 Beta on a non-Ubuntu Linux. Please 
refer to this post: 
<a href="https://behainguyen.wordpress.com/2022/06/25/synology-ds218-preparing-python-3-9-beta-compelete-devepment-environment/"
title="Synology DS218: preparing Python 3.9 Beta compelete development environment"
target="_blank">Synology DS218: preparing Python 3.9 Beta compelete development environment</a>. 
That was the only time I installed Python on a Linux system.

For Python 3.12.4, it appears we need to install it from the source code, as 
indicated on this 
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/source/" title="Python Source Releases" 
target="_blank">download page</a>.

I followed the instructions in the section ‚Äú<em>Method 2: Install Python From Source Code</em>‚Äù 
from the post <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu" 
title="How to Install Python 3 on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04" 
target="_blank">How to Install Python 3 on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04</a>.

My steps are as follows:

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-1"></a>
‚ìµ Checking the currently active Python version and its installation path 
using the following commands:

```
python3 --version
which python3
```

Please refer to the illustration in the screenshot below:

{% include image-gallery.html list=page.gallery-image-list-1 %}
<br/>

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-2"></a>
‚ì∂ Download <code>Python-3.12.4.tgz</code> to <code>/home/behai/Public/</code>.

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-3"></a>
‚ì∑ Extract the compressed files using the following command:

```
tar -xf /home/behai/Public/Python-3.12.4.tgz
```

The files are extracted to <code>/home/behai/Python-3.12.4/</code>.
Please see the screenshot illustration below:

{% include image-gallery.html list=page.gallery-image-list-2 %}
<br/>

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-4"></a>
‚ì∏ Change to the directory <code>/home/behai/Python-3.12.4/</code>. 
The command is:

```
behai@hp-pavilion-15:~$ cd Python-3.12.4/
```

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-5"></a>
‚ìπ Test system and optimise Python. The command is:

```
behai@hp-pavilion-15:~/Python-3.12.4$ ./configure --enable-optimizations
```

This command produces a long output and takes a few minutes to complete. 
I did not encounter any problems.

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-6"></a>
‚ì∫ Finally, install Python 3.12.4. As stated in the introduction, I want 
this version to be an additional installation, so the command is: 

```
behai@hp-pavilion-15:~/Python-3.12.4$ sudo make altinstall
```

It took nearly 20 minutes to complete, with a very long output. No errors were reported.

üí• <strong>I would like to point out that</strong> I had some vague ideas about what the above steps do: they compile and build the Python interpreter from the source. However, I did not know where Python 3.12.4 was installed. From the output, I knew the installation was successful, but I was unsure of the installation path for Python 3.12.4.

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-7"></a>
‚ìª Verify Python version. I reran the first command from 
<a href="#ubuntu-22-10-step-1">Step 1</a>: 

```
python3 --version
```

I was unsure, but I was expecting Python 3.10.7. And it is.

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-step-8"></a>
‚ìº üêç Python 3.12.4's path is <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.12</code>.

After some searching, I came across this page 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python" 
title="2.2. Building Python" 
target="_blank">https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python</a>,
which discusses installing Python from source code. This page led me to 
this section 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-prefix" 
title="--prefix=PREFIX" 
target="_blank">https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-prefix</a>.

These two pages effectively point out that the default installation location 
for the command <code>make altinstall</code> is <code>/usr/local</code>. 
I have been able to verify that. Please see the screenshot illustration below:

{% include image-gallery.html list=page.gallery-image-list-3 %}
<br/>

<a id="ubuntu-22-10-venv-virtual-env"></a>
To create a virtual environment (<code>venv</code>) for Python 3.12.4, 
use the following command:

```
behai@hp-pavilion-15:~/fastapi$ /usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv venv
```

üöÄ Before writing this post, I tested the Python 3.12.4 installation by creating 
a virtual environment (<code>venv</code>) and running a web server application 
from this <code>venv</code>.

The installation of Python 3.12.4 as an additional interpreter on Ubuntu 22.10 and Windows 10 appears to be in working order.

Thank you for reading. I hope you find the information in this post useful. Stay safe, as always.
