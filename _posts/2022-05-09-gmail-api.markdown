title: "GMail API: quick start with Python and NodeJs."

---

I've carried out Google's instructions to set up a Google Cloud Platform 
project which enables GMail API; and I'm able to send out emails using the 
generated credentials file provided by the Google Cloud Platform. The 
credentials file is used for both Python and NodeJs.
